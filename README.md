# timeseries_data_visualization

Welcome to this project!
In order to create this application I have used the following libraries and dependencies: AntDesign, axios, json-server, react-router and react-dom.

ðŸ“Œ Installation guide:

1. Clone the Repository using the command:
   **git clone https://github.com/thaliagit/timeseries_data_visualization.git**
2. To navigate through the directory use the command below:
   **cd timeseries_data_visualization**
3. In order to have the required dependencies installed please type the command below after making sure you are in the first-level directory:
   **npm install**
   (This will ensure you have installed all the dependencies you need in order to start the app. Tip: you can check if something is missing in your package.json file)

ðŸŒŸ Starting the application:

1. For this project I mocked the database using the json-server library in order to represent a more realistic data retrieving experience. Before starting the application it is essential to start the server by using the following command:
   **npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001**
   (IMPORTANT: use only the port 3001 as it is set otherwise the get request will fail)
2. In order to start the app use the command below on the repository you have cloned in your local:
   **npm start**

This will automatically start the application by opening a new window on the browser.

Happy Navigating! ðŸ’»ðŸ˜ƒ
